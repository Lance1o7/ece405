## Introduction

The energy of an Ising system is described by the Hamiltonian

$$ \mathcal{H} = -\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle} J \sigma_i\sigma_j, $$

```{admonition} How to pronounce "Ising"?
Though commonly called the Ising model, the model itself existed before [Ernst Ising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Ising) (read “Easing”) solved analytically a one-dimensional system. [↗](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10308838)
