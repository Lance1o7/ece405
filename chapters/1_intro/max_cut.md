# MAX-CUT Problem

## Introduction

MAX-CUT problem is a well-known NP-hard problem. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, the goal is to find a partition of the vertices $V$ into two sets $S$ and $T$ such that the number of edges between $S$ and $T$ is maximized. The problem is NP-hard since it is equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum independent set in a graph, which is known to be NP-hard.
